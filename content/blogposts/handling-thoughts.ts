      text: "Seriation is the human hability to find a logical order in a set of things, wether that's through size, weight or colour, and also predict what may follow. According to Jean Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory, involving four stages of children development, it is on the third stage, the concrete operational stage, that the abstract principle of seriation is developed.",

      text: "Epiphany, still the subject of much study, is a sudden flash of insight or experience of realization. Usually, it is triggered by a new piece of information, after a thorough research process, that leads to a new idea, theory or solution - a clash of perpendicular planes of thought, like Arthur Koestler summarized. The most famous epiphanies are the 'Eureka!' cheer by Archimedes and Newton's apple.",

      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Sticky notes are small colourful pieces of paper with a readherable glue strip where one can write and draw different ideas, problems, concepts, and then physically move them, to compare, cluster, order, add and remove them at will. The different colours can assist in distinguishing information to more easily make sense of a complex system.",
