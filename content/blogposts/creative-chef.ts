Their strong skill set when it comes to preparing food, allows them to be creative with their recipes by understanding how to combine flavours in exciting ways to create new unique dishes. Furthermore, many creative chefs are almost obsessive about learning more and perfecting their craft, constantly experimenting with ingredients and techniques to come up with new ideas.",

      text: "A powerful tool that creative chefs utilize when crafting new dishes is analogy thinking. It involves drawing similarities between two different concepts. This can be done by exploring the common attributes or patterns of things. In the case of cooking, a chef could look at the flavours in an ingredient and draw parallels with other ingredients to come up with unique flavour combinations they wouldn't have otherwise have thought of before using analogy thinking. This has been adopted by many cooks around the world who are looking for ways to delight their guests through food.",

      text: "For example, hummus, the delicious spread from the Middle East and Mediterranean region, is typically made by blending chickpeas, tahini, lemon and other spices together. Chickpeas are a versatile, nutrient-rich bean commonly used in Middle Eastern cuisine. They can be harvested fresh or dried for storage and convenience. Tahini paste is made from ground roasted sesame seeds and has a nut butter-like consistency. It adds creaminess to the hummus along with its nutty flavour profile. Lemon is added for an acidic punch that helps balance out the flavours, as well as helping in whipping up the tahini into a creamy paste.",

      text: "By deconstructing the recipe with Analogy Thinking, a creative chef can substitute different ingredients for the traditional ones to create unique variations on the dish. The beauty of this type of thinking is that you can take this simple pattern and make multiple different spreads or dips with just a few tweaks. Instead of chickpeas, try switching it up with other beans such as Kidney Beans, Black-eye Peas, or Lentils for an entirely new flavour profile. If you’re looking for something more nutty and creamy, replace the tahini with another nut butter such as Pistachio butter, Pumpkin seed butter, or Peanut butter. To give your spread an extra punch of flavour use different acidic ingredients instead of lemon such as White vinegar, Grapefruit juice, or even Tomato.",

      text: "When you think like a creative chef, the possibilities are endless. Use the traditional recipes to expand your horizons and explore different flavours and texture combinations that could make for an unforgettable meal. However, some of these experimental combos may not be palatable, or even safe, so it's important to proceed with caution when cooking outside the recipe books. With enough practice and research, though, there is no limit to what kind of culinary delights you can create.",
