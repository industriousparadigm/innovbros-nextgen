'Dooring' is the expression used to define such accidents, which also affects other car drivers, motorcyclists, joggers or someone pushing a stroller, and is a serious issue worldwide that can result in severe injury or death. As a result, it is an offense in many states of the USA, the UK, and other countries.",

      text: "Although dooring statistics are simply a portray of the scale of the problem, since most occurrences are not registered, these incidents are rising and, while accounting for around 6% of bicycle and motor vehicle crashes, have the highest injury risk at 10% of all injured cyclists. In the UK, between 2011 and 2015, and according to the Department for Transport, there were 3108 doorings and eight fatalities, of which 2009 were cyclists as well as five of the deaths.",

    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Dooring occurs because doors extend the physical limits of the vehicle without any warning to the people around it, adding an unforeseeable obstacle in the path. Also, only a few people opening the car door are attentive of incoming traffic, mostly because of the affordances of the handles. These, although facilitating the opening of the door, difficult passenger's awareness of what is around the vehicle.",

      type: "Paragraph",

      text: "Of all these approaches to tackle dooring, the Dutch Reach is the most known (27). It is a simple method without costly infrastructure expenses that can reduce the risk of dooring. Nevertheless, the Dutch Reach has to be taught because reaching with your farthest hand, by turning your body to face incoming traffic, goes against the affordances of the car door. After all, the door handle is designed to be easily accessible with the door's closest hand.",
    },
    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Consequently, one can design the car door to minimize dooring by changing the location of the door handle towards the back of the door or approximately aligned with the driver or passenger's shoulder. This change simplifies the door system as the handle is closer to the lock. Moreover, the Dutch Reach, which puts you facing the traffic, eliminating blind spots, and ensures the door just opens slightly, warning other people of your intent, becomes the natural and comfortable way to open a car door. Fundamentally, the suggested door handle design contextualizes how the door should be opened and enables a more comprehensive understanding of the environment around the vehicle.",

      text: "Obviously, this article only highlights the issue and introduces some solutions. Dooring needs to be minimized and has been addressed throughout the world, with a variety of initiatives and inventions. Essentially, it will be up to the industry, regulators, and government officials, but also up to us to push for changes. Not only by encouraging mobility stakeholders to implement better solutions, but also by being more aware and conscious of others - simply by looking before opening the door.",
