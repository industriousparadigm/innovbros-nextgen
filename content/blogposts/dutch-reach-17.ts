It is a serious issue worldwide that affects other car drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians with potential severe results. While dooring accounts for around 6% of all traffic accidents, it is the highest injury risk for cycling commuters, 10%.",

      text: "The Dutch Reach is a simple method to reduce the risk of dooring in which a passenger reaches the door handle with her farthest hand, thus facing all incoming traffic. With the current interior car door handle design, this method has to be taught and deliberately employed every time she opens the door.",

      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "However, one can design the car door to force the Dutch Reach by changing the location of the interior door handle towards the back of the door, approximately aligned with the passenger's shoulder. This way makes it natural and comfortable to prevent unnecessary accidents, simply by compelling her to look before opening the door.",
