      text: "People are increasingly using eCommerce to purchase their day-to-day goods due to its convenience and ease. Some of the products bought are temperature sensitive, such as chocolate, that need to have their temperature controlled and stable during transport from warehouse to consumer.",

      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Currently, temperature sensitive products are usually packed in a mixed material parcel with, for example, Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) or cool packs inside a cardboard box which are difficult or impossible to recycle. Additionally, consumers are strongly influenced and prepared to pay extra for sustainable solutions.",

The process used, expands the paper pulp with air, lowering its density and increasing its thermal protection.",
