      text: "People's posture affects their comfort and well-being, leading to musculo-skeletal problems, poor posture and injuries. Adjustable portable furniture could be all it takes to promote better health and increase individual's freedom and autonomy which, evidence suggests, could bring about an increase in overall quality of life, productivity, while reducing the dangers of our largely sedentary lifestyle.",

      text: "The solution designed was a portable desk consisting of a frame-structure and a collapsible table top, ergonomically designed to enable a comfortable working posture anywhere. The versatile design also allows it to be converted from a counter weighted desk into a stand alone table by simply turning around the frame structure. This way, the user has the flexibility to use it as a sidetable or put on any other table to turn it into a standing desk as well depending on her needs. The solution developed was submitted for patent (WO2017126985A1) and, although the examiners feedback was extremelly positive, the patent was abandoned due to fees costs.",

Following this, a 'Resource list', consisting of super system, system and sub system, was drawn in order to make use of the resources in the environment. Through out the project a 'Bad Solutions Park' was utilised and with the information from the 'Ideal Outcome & Ultimate Goal' and the 'Resource list' and the help of other creativity tools - biosociation, brainstorming, reframing, etc - the 'Bad Solutions' board resulted in 50, or so, concepts.",

      text: "First the team used the 'Trends of Evolution Scale' to increase the ideality of the portable desk. This was done by analysing the position of the conceptual technology along the scale, seeing where the solution could move closer to the ideal. Specific trends were further explored such as 'Simplification through Trimming', the concept was dissected and all the unnecessary parts trimmed; as well as 'Line Geometric Evolution', to streamline the folding-into-carrying-mode procedure; and finally 'Actions Co-ordinations' to make the experience of the user more objective and comprehensible.",

      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Subsequently, since all requirements were not yet fulfilled, the team uncovered a number of contradictions and looked up the relevant using the '40 Inventive Principles' to generate new ideas and improvements to solve these contradictions: improving the 'Weight of Stationary Object' without making 'Volume of Stationary Object' worse; improving the 'Volume of Stationary Object' without making 'Strength' worse; and improving the 'Weight of Stationary Object' without making 'Strength' worse. This tool helped the team to think about the materials and the shape of the product, and to improve the interactions between user and product, thus enriching the user's experience. In particular, the Inventive Principle 9, one of the solutions to the Volume-Strength contradiction, suggest the idea of creating beforehand stresses in an object that will oppose known undesirable working stresses later on, which sparked the idea of using both compression and tension forces that annulate each other to have a bigger stable working surface.",
