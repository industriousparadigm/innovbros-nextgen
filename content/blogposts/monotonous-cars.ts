      text: "Undeniably, a fantastical sci-fi future is right around the corner, with autonomous driving becoming mainstream in the second half of the 2020s and human-driving being prohibited soon after. However, many are portraying an appalling 'one-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe on chest and boots' future. A uniformed transportation system in which swarms of white pod-like looking vehicles transport people from A to B.",

Considering, not only the dozens of automotive car brands, with a breath of models, targeting different types of people at varied price points, with diverse technical and aesthetic characteristics, that exist nowadays, but also people's emphasis on their experience and lifestyle, the companies that highlight the passenger experience will succeed.",

      text: "Indeed, the experience of being in a car is much more than driving. There's the comfort of the seat, the smell of the car, the noise it makes and music, the view out the window, the socializing, etc. With autonomous driving, everyone will become passengers, and both the way the car is driven and the vehicle influences the experience.",

      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Autonomous vehicles will improve road traffic and safety through better traffic management, effective driving patterns, powerful reaction times, and inter-communication. All these will lead to significant reductions in greenhouse emissions and energy usage, and a better capitalization of resources by decreasing the number of vehicles on the road while intensifying cars utilization, together with shorten commuting time as a result of faster journeys and not having to park, freeing up on-street space for other activities.",

      text: "However, research shows that consumers won't be satisfied with these alone. The mobility experience will need to meet the varied social, personal and cultural needs of each individual. Considering that many companies will have a share of the industry, there will be dozens of driverless cars, with different technical and aesthetic characteristics, as well as varied ownership and service provision models.",

Essentially, each person will have her personalized chauffeur;",

      text: "In the end, self-driving vehicles' positive tests on the open road, the continuous technological developments and progressive market penetration, sums up as an exciting future. And although many industries will be affected, the driverless car will, like the automotive car in the beginning of the 20th century, be a platform for new business opportunities, innovation, and social growth. Still, the design of the experience is essential, after all, traveling is a major element of people's lives.",
