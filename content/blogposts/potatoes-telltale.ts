    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Despite the many nutritional benefits of potatoes, when they were first introduced in Europe by the Spanish in the 16th century, potatoes were received with distrust. This new and unfamiliar plant from a far away land was obviously not traditionally part of the European diet yet, and the fact that it was cultivated for its underground tubers and not its fruit or leaves, made a lot of people uneasy about the idea of eating it.",

This was specially important for feeding the growing European population during the Industrial Revolution, as potatoes are high in carbohydrates and are a good source of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre.",

      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "The French campaign that showcased potatoes was a far-reaching episode for both the crop and humanity. Equally relevant is the innovation wisdom and framework that can be identified and replicated for any future disruptive innovations.",
