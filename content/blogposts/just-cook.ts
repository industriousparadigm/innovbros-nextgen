      text: "I've always loved to cook. It all started by helping my grandmother make Sunday lunch. She would teach me and answer my questions about the process: why do we have to marinate the meat overnight or preheat the oven? These taught me how to cook and soon was experimenting with different flavors and seeking the varied cooking methods and styles.",

      text: "When I was 8 y-old, there was this situation in which some chips were being fried and, out of the blue, the pan bursts into flames! Now I know it was due to some water on the fries' surface, but at the time I just froze. Gladly my grandmother was right beside me and quickly drowned the fire with a cloth, nonetheless, the house would have burnt to the ground.",

      text: "Eventually, I started cooking the family dinners. Sometimes as a sidekick, others as lead or simply flying solo. I enjoyed it so much that I even considered studying to become a professional cook. Still, it is great fun to be in a kitchen and prepare and cook a meal that people enjoy.",

      text: "The reason for this relates with what Gordon Clark, a character from TV-series Halt and Catch Fire, said about cooking: ‘You get to cook something, and then you look at it, and you think, 'I made this!' And then you get to eat it and then move on. That makes me happy.’ In this way, cooking is all about constructing a meal that is pleasurable and enjoyable, about experimenting with new combinations of flavors and ingredients, learning different techniques and apply them in new ways, but also about the fast cycle of designing, finishing, and delivering the dishes.",

      text: "Ferran Adrià said, ‘to cook is to design food’, which the design community recognized when awarded the Spanish chef with Europe's most notorious designer award. Actually, many known historical figures, for instance, Leonardo da Vinci and Raymond Loewy, that are acknowledged for their craftiness, inventiveness, and design work, were interested in cuisine.",

      text: "In this way, cooking is similar to design. Essentially, the culinary process, from problem definition through idea generation and shipping, runs in a fast-forward approach in just a few hours, with its practice being fairly analogous to the New Product Development (NPD) one.",
    },
    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "The more significant differences between design and culinary arts are time-bound, product related, and linked to the satisfied need. These refer to the product life-cycle, the human daily diet, the cooking pace, and immediate feedback loop. In fact, these results in cuisine as a microcosm of design. And, since almost everyone knows what a Chef does, cooking can be used to teach what design and innovation are, and train people in the different tools, methods, and frameworks of NPD.",

      text: "For instance, my pan in fire incident is analogous to a disaster in the development of a product, service or system. It was the first time I was deep-frying potatoes and didn't follow the process correctly, specifically the drying of the slices before laying them in the boiling oil. In design, too, the varied steps of the process are crucial for a smoother design and development of the solution to the problem at hand.",
    },
    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Another illustrative example is the iterative re-design of both a dish and a solution. Cooks, to deliver a flavourful experience, have to continuously taste and adjust the seasoning according to their desired and imagined output. Likewise, designers have to incessantly test and evaluate their solutions, and go back to the drawing board to remodel the design.",

    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Cooking is a pleasurable and joyful activity that results in a product made out of a combination of ingredients that are transformed by, like Victor Papanek's definition of design, ‘the conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order’. The similarity of culinary arts with design and the timeframe of cooking makes it an ideal discipline to teach people to understand and think like a designer.",
