      text: "Our sensory systems help us appreciate art, music, food, perfumes, and people. Also, it maintains our awareness of the surroundings, warning us of threats and limiting our injuries. However, despite the widespread belief of five basic senses, our body comprehends between three and thousands of senses, depending on how 'sense' is defined.",
    },
    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "This popular thought of sight, smell, sound, touch, and taste, as our senses, can be traced back to Aristotle and has perpetuated as a fact ever since. Most think that at least the additional four senses of body awareness, pain, temperature, and balance should be included in the list. These wide-ranging number of senses awes people at first, then their importance and unconsciously use throughout the day is realized.",
    },
    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Despite our diversity of sensory systems, the human construction of the world mostly relies on sight. Nearly all objects and designs around us are determined by their visual cues. There's the billboard with huge colorful printed text, accompanied with images; the almost ubiquitous smartphone with its diversity of apps and paired interface within a glass window; and the road with the myriad of lights and signs.",
    },
    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "This focus on the visual sense limits our creative potential and the scope of the design solutions. After all, our perception and experience of the world around us is the result of an intricate multisensory smoothie. The senses function as one, influencing each other perception and shaping our understanding of reality. To demonstrate this argument, Harry McGurk developed an experiment that shows that the lips movement of a speaker affects the listener's hearing: if we watch a clip showing a person moving her lips as if saying 'Gah', but reproducing the 'Bah' sound, we hear 'Dah'.",

    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "A more familiar example is how a dining experience is influenced not exclusively by our taste but by a holistic sensory experience. A blocked nose reduces the tasting of food, the environment sound enriches the flavors, the texture and even the color of the food change the savoring. If you think about it, most restaurants focus on the food and the best ones consciously prepare all the details of the experience.",

    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "As things go, our brains only perceive pieces of reality, which are stitched together by adding information in the gaps. In essence, although we think we experience the world as is, our experience of reality is a mental interpretation, with our senses as input and directed by our brain.",

      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Imagine this scenario: some friends go to a music arena for a concert. They are in the lighted arena with fellow spectators waiting for the musicians to appear from behind the stage to begin the show. At the illuminated stage there's nothing but the band's instruments. Out of a sudden, the lights go off, and the drummer starts pounding. Instantly, the crowd cheer and clap and the other musicians jump onto the stage. An awesome music and light show follow throughout that evening. The friends' experience is holistic, with the sound of the band and crowd, the musician's showmanship and light show, even the smell and temperature of the arena or the taste of the food and drinks they enjoy influence their enjoyment - as well as the connection they have with each other.",
    },
    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "Also, in the above example, there's the drummer playing in the dark. She can drum without lights because of her sense of body awareness or proprioception, in conjugation with her other senses, such as sound and balance, and her drumming experience and practice. Proprioception concerns with our awareness of the position of our body, where our arms and legs are at any moment of time in relation to the remaining parts of the body.",
    },
    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "This body awareness unconsciously extends to the tools we use. As a matter of fact, one of our main difference with other animals is the use of tools as extensions of our body. Indeed, the more experienced with a tool we are, the more natural we seem to be with it. Try this: hold a non-sharp object with your best hand, then close your eyes and touch your knee with the tip of the object. In some way you knew where the tip of the object was and the location of your knee.",
    },
    {
      type: "Paragraph",
      text: "In fact, designers must know and understand our sensorial perception of the world, not only the Aristotelian five senses, but also the other senses we have - or don't have but other animals do, to more creatively design better solutions and more exciting products, services, systems, communications, and experiences. Surely the design of a service involves thinking about the different sensorial touchpoints, the design of a device should make use of our bodily senses and physical limitations, and the design of a marketing campaign must consider more than the visual cues.",
